Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary:
Step 1: Select and Install Operating System
I chose to install Windows 11 as my operating system. I downloaded the installation media from the official Microsoft website and followed the installation instructions.
Step 2: Install Text Editor or IDE
I selected Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my text editor and IDE. I downloaded the installation package from the official VS Code website and followed the installation instructions.

Step 3: Set Up Version Control System
I installed Git on my local machine by downloading the installation package from the official Git website. I then created a GitHub account and initialized a new repository for my project.
I created a new folder for my project and initialized a Git repository using the command git init. I then added my project files to the repository using the command git add. and made my first commit using the command git commit -m "Initial commit".
Step 4: Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes
I installed Python from the official Python website. I downloaded the installation package and followed the installation instructions.

Step 5: Install Package Managers
I installed pip, the package manager for Python, using the command python -m ensurepip.
Step 6: Configure a Database (MySQL)
I downloaded and installed MySQL database from the official MySQL website. I followed the installation instructions and configured the database to use a root password.




Step 7: Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization 
I did not set up virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines for this project.
Step 8: Explore Extensions and Plugins
I explored available extensions and plugins for VS Code to enhance functionality. I installed the following extensions:
Python extension for syntax highlighting and linting
Git extension for version control integration
MySQL extension for database management
Reflection on Challenges and Solutions
During the setup process, I encountered some challenges, such as configuring the MySQL database to use a root password. I overcame this challenge by referring to the official MySQL documentation and seeking help from online forums.
GitHub Repository
My GitHub repository can be found at [insert GitHub repository link]. It contains a sample project initialized with Git and the necessary configuration files (e.g.,.gitignore).
Conclusion
In this assignment, I set up a developer environment with Windows 11, VS Code, Git, Python, pip, and MySQL. I configured my environment to use version control, package management, and database management. I also explored available extensions and plugins to enhance functionality. I encountered some challenges during the setup process, but I was able to overcome them by seeking help from online resources.
